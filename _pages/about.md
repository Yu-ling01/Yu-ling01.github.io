I'm currently a PhD candidate at [Lettres Sorbonne Université](https://lettres.sorbonne-universite.fr/), working within the [Sens, Texte, Informatique, Histoire](http://stih-sorbonne-universite.fr/) laboratory. My research focuses on creating a comprehensive reference grammar for Haoni, a Southern Loloish language within the Tibeto-Burman family. My academic interests include descriptive and general linguistics, linguistic typology, André Martinet’s functional linguistics, and historical linguistics
